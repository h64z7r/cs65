ENED 1100 – ACTIVITIES AND HOMEWORK 
W7D1: LABVIEW REPETITION
TASK 1 (OF 2) 
PART A 
Create   a Flowchart and   develop   a LabVIEW VI that   computes   a   sum   of odd   integers   using   the   equation:
The   value   of x   should   start   at 0. The   final   value   of the   equation   2x+1   (ie:   the   final   odd   number   added to the sum) should   be defined by the user using a numeric input (control) on the Front Panel.   The final value of   y (ie: the sum of   odd numbers) should be displayed for the user using a numeric   output (indicator) on the Front   Panel.
PART B To check that your LabVIEW VI is operating correctly, create a trace table that   tracks   the   values   of   x   andy   for   five   iterations   (the   final   value   of   y   should   be   1+3+5+7+9=25). Add   your   trace   table to the same file containing your flowchart   for   submission.
TASK 2 (OF 2) 
Repetition flow is often used to   create   simulations. Using   repetition,   you   can   repeatedly   simulate   events to determine the probability of   a given outcome.
Create   a LabVIEW VI that   simulates   the   simple   experiment   of flipping a coin.   Remember,   flipping a coin can only have two outcomes: Heads,   or   Tails.   Your   flow   diagr代 写ENED 1100 – ACTIVITIES AND HOMEWORK W7D1: LABVIEW REPETITIONPython

•         allow   the   user   to input the   number   of   times   to   flip   the   coin,
•         determine   the   result   of the   coin   flip   by   randomly   producing   a   value   corresponding   to   1   (heads) or   0   (tails),
•       record/track   the   number   of   times   the   coin   landed   on   aheads   or   a   tails,   and
• output the   final percentage of   flips   that   were   heads and the percentage that   were   tails after all flips have been   simulated.
Use   the Random Number (0-1) block   from   the Numeric section   of the   Functions Palette to simulate your coin   flip.This block will randomly generate a decimal number between 0 and 1. You   can   use   this   decimal   to   determine   the   result   of a   coin   flip   in   a   number   of   different   ways.   You   can   round   the   number to   the   nearest   integer   (0   or   1),   compare   the   random   number   to   0.5   to   see   if   it   is   above   or   below   that   midpoint (x>0.5?), or use another similar method.Random Number   Block
NOTE: If   you   need   to   flip   a   coin   repeatedly, does   the   Random   Number   block   need   togo inside your   loop, or outside of   it?
